Thought Collector
=================

A fairly full-featured wiki developed in 2006 using PHP.

Some interesting features:

* Pages
* Tags
* Discussions
* User Administration

This requires my simple object framework developed at
about the same time (also now on github).

This code hasn't been touched since 2006.  If it breaks 
something, you get to keep both pieces...
